### Hello World!

I'm Syed, a software engineer specializing in Front-End development using React, React-Native, TypeScript, and GraphQL applications. On the back-end side, I have no preference for a specific API development language, however I mostly use Go or Node.

Presently, I'm studying computer science in the majority of my days. I'm enjoying the process of understanding algorithms as mathematical and functional patterns. I'm also quite immersed in systems design and API development going as far as having used services on AWS such as Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, S3 on using a Free Tier account.

In my previous role, I joined a startup backed by the US government to accelerate federal procurement. Together with PMs, designers, and engineers, we tackled some of the toughest challenges in the contracting space.

Here are the details about a project I'm proud of: [React-Native CoreML](https://github.com/syedwshah/RNCoreML),  enables integration of machine learning models into apps on a native display, a powerful offline service removing the requiring knowledge of Swift/Objective C programming language for developers.

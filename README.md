### Hello World! 👽👍

I'm Syed, a software engineer specializing in Front-End development using React, React-Native,TypeScript, and GraphQL for native and web applications. On the back-end side, I have a preference for API development using Go Lang or serverless architecture using Amazon Web Services.

I am currently seeking an environment that is culturally mission-driven, team-oriented, and possesses a growth mindset. With experience working both in-person and fully remote in cross-functional agile environments, I thrive on collaborative and challenging projects.

In my most recent role, I joined a startup backed by the US government to accelerate federal procurement. Together with PMs, designers, and engineers, I tackled some of the toughest challenges in the contracting space. During my time at Bidscale, I had the opportunity to witness significant team growth. While I did not have any direct reports, I frequently served as a point of contact for guidance, code assistance, and peer reviews. I was readily available to offer support and help my colleagues navigate their coding challenges.

When I'm not working for a specific organization, I usually dedicate my time to building open-source projects. One of my notable projects is [React-Native CoreML](https://github.com/syedwshah/RNCoreML), which enables engineers to integrate machine learning models into apps on a local device, providing a powerful offline service.

### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Syed, a software engineer specializing in Front-End development using React, TypeScript, and GraphQL for both mobile and web applications. On the back-end side, I am language and framework agnostic, but I have a preference for API development using Go Lang or serverless architecture using Amazon Web Services.

I am currently seeking an environment that is culturally mission-driven, team-oriented, and possesses a growth mindset. With experience working both in-person and fully remote in cross-functional agile environments, I thrive on collaborative and challenging projects.

In my most recent role, I joined a startup backed by the US government to accelerate federal procurement. Together with PMs, designers, and engineers, I tackled some of the toughest challenges in the contracting space. I take pride in knowing that my work has the potential to improve the lives of every American, as our SaaS offerings can advance sectors such as the military, healthcare, and education. I played a key role in building two offerings from the ground up: Bidscale Select and Bidscale Connect, which are expected to generate a combined revenue of $10M/year.

During my time at Bidscale, I had the opportunity to witness significant team growth. While I did not have any direct reports, I frequently served as a point of contact for guidance, code assistance, and peer reviews. I was readily available to offer support and help my colleagues navigate their coding challenges.

When I'm not working for a specific organization, I usually dedicate my time to building open-source projects. One of my notable projects is React-Native CoreML, which enables engineers to integrate machine learning models into apps on a local device, providing a powerful offline service.

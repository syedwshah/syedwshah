### Hello World!

I'm Syed, a software engineer specializing in Front-End development using React/React-Native, TypeScript, and GraphQL. On the back-end side, I mostly use Go or Node.

In my previous role as a software engineer, I worked at a startup backed by the US government to accelerate federal procurement. Together with PMs, designers, and engineers, we tackled challenges in the contracting space.

Presently, I'm quite immersed in systems design and API development going as far as having used services on AWS such as Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, S3 using my AWS account. I am also frequently writing tech articles pertaining to Systems Design, API Design, OOD, and DSAs.

Here are the details about a project I'm proud of: [React-Native CoreML](https://github.com/syedwshah/RNCoreML),  enables integration of machine learning models into apps on a native display, a powerful offline service removing the requiring knowledge of Swift/Objective C programming language for developers.
